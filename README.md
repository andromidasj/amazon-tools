# Amazon Tools

![SCR-20230119-g10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66661368/213518065-56f9a732-dc75-44cd-8641-0cfe8a0ed3c9.png)

This was my attempt at making a tool for a friend to make it easy to get a list of ASINs from an Amazon search results page. The current implementation is slow, and uses [JSDOM](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) for webscraping. I could look into efficiency improvements in the future if I decide to keep developing in the future.

Scaffolding done with [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/).
